

1. Primary Weaknesses in Risk Management Strategy
------------------------------------------------
- Inadequate Identity and Access Management (IAM) controls
- Absence of least privilege principle implementation
- Lack of continuous monitoring for suspicious activities
- No formal incident response plan
- Insufficient employee vetting procedures
- Failure to conduct regular risk assessments
- Poor segregation of duties

2. IAM Failures and Improvements
---------------------------------
Contributing Factors:
- Over-provisioned user privileges
- Lack of multi-factor authentication
- No role-based access control (RBAC)
- Inactive account management failures

Recommended Improvements:
- Implement Zero Trust architecture
- Enforce principle of least privilege
- Deploy privileged access management (PAM)
- Introduce mandatory MFA for all accounts
- Establish regular access reviews
- Implement user behavior analytics (UBA)

3. Strengthening Incident Response
---------------------------------
Key Steps:
1. Develop formal incident response plan (IRP)
2. Establish CSIRT (Computer Security Incident Response Team)
3. Implement SIEM for real-time monitoring
4. Create escalation procedures
5. Conduct regular tabletop exercises
6. Establish communication protocols
7. Develop business continuity plans

4. Forensic Investigation Techniques
-----------------------------------
- Disk imaging and memory forensics
- Log analysis from all affected systems
- Network traffic analysis
- Timeline reconstruction
- Malware analysis if applicable
- Chain of custody documentation
- Employee workstation audits

5. Enhanced Risk Assessment Strategy
-----------------------------------
- Conduct regular penetration testing
- Implement continuous vulnerability scanning
- Adopt threat modeling framework
- Perform red team/blue team exercises
- Establish third-party risk management
- Implement security metrics and KPIs

6. Insider Threat Mitigation Controls
------------------------------------
- Implement data loss prevention (DLP)
- Deploy user and entity behavior analytics (UEBA)
- Enforce strict access controls
- Monitor privileged users
- Implement secure offboarding procedures
- Establish whistleblower program

7. DDoS Protection Strategies
----------------------------
- Implement cloud-based DDoS protection
- Deploy on-premise scrubbing centers
- Configure rate limiting
- Use anycast network distribution
- Implement Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- Develop DDoS response playbook
- Conduct regular stress testing

8. Addressing Compliance Failures
--------------------------------
- Conduct compliance gap analysis
- Implement GRC (Governance, Risk, Compliance) platform
- Appoint compliance officer
- Establish continuous compliance monitoring
- Document all security controls
- Schedule regular audits
- Implement automated compliance reporting

9. Employee Training Program
---------------------------
Key Components:
- Regular security awareness training
- Phishing simulation exercises
- Insider threat case studies
- Secure coding practices (for IT)
- Social engineering defense training
- Incident reporting procedures
- Consequences of policy violations
